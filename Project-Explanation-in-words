a terraform script for a vpc that span across 2 availability zones A and B with 1 public subnet and 2 private subnets. The subnets should span accross the two availability zones A and B
The vpc should access the internet through the internet gateway
There should be an application load balancer between availability zone A and B
There should be a NAT gateway for the 2 private subnets in the public subnet
The application load balancer on the 2 availability zones should direct traffic to Nginx proxy server in the public subnet in an autoscaling group.
Configure a bastion host in the pubic subnet for access in the private subnets
The proxy server in the public subnet should direct traffic to another application load balancer in the private subnet which direct traffic to a tomcat servers in a autoscalling group in the first private subnet
The web servers in the first private subnet is connected to a multi availability zone mysql RDS in the second private subnet,
All the instances created should use the same key-pair which should be saved on the control machine
